# Website for sharing 360 media

The goal of this project was to design and develop a website that allows its users to share,
view, and download 360-degree media. The website was built with React and Django.
It provides features such as:
- uploading your own images, videos and virtual tours
- viewing uploaded images with built in interactive 360 image viewer
- viewing shared media of other users (with search option)
